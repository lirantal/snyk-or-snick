# About

Is it Snyk or Snick?

Who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

But now you can race your friend for it straight from the CLI!

# Usage

How to play the game?

```bash
npx snyk-or-snick
```

- Snyk player uses the keyboard key `s`
- Snick player uses the keyboard key `'`

Press the keys like a mad-man until you hit 100% progress and win the right pronunciation üéâ

## Tip

I specifically built this game around a [Webee keyboard](https://shop-il.webee-world.com/) that I bought for my son, so if you have one you can just plug it in to the USB port and start playing with the keys:
